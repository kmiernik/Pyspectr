===========

Pyspectr provides nuclear spectroscopy tools, specifically targeted
to use with the his/drr histogram files used by the upak library. Apart from
reading the binary input files, it provides some tools like half-life fitting,
peak-fitting and pydamm program, mimicking the DAMM program from the upak.
Users are encouraged to use pydamm within ipython3 shell, as it offers a great
advantages over standard python3 shell, such as tab-completion with history
search, input/outputs registry (as in Maxima or Mathematica), etc.  However, it
is also possible to work with pydamm with the standard python3 shell.

This package requires the following modules:
numpy, matplotlib, lmfit
